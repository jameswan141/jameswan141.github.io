Change Log

* I added files of computer languages with codes. I used them to practice creating codes whether its classes or styles in order to master or become familiar with the various languages.
* I changed the format of the introduction above compared to the original version. It just serves to make it tidy and less messy.
* I added issues to show my knowledge of things like HTML meaningful tags. It helps me to make sure that not only do I know how to create codes, but I understand the purpose of each keyword, when not to use them, and so forth.
* I added a project in order to keep track of how far I am in the mastery of computer languages.



TODO

* I will make the introduction, Change Log, TODO and future sections more fancy and full screens and maybe have the sections listed on the left-hand screen and clickable so reading the site will be easier.
* I will add more code to the uploaded files so that learning the programming languages can be easier as time goes on. I can learn new and harder stuff such as elements, avoiding the any time so that I can reach the goal of mastering the languages by the end of the semester.
* I will add more issues so that my knowledge on the languages will only expand.



Problems and Moving Forward

* When I was dealing with HTML, I was confused with the syntax of the meaningful tags because of the <> brackets. However, I began to notice that their usage is similar to those with curly brackets in languages like Python, C, C++, and Java. Because of the similarity, the practice with code that involves the elements became easier. Nonetheless, I'm still struggling with some of the elements of HTML. I'll continue to practice with those elements and go on to new elements and more. 
* When I was dealing with CSS, the styles and classes took some practice for me to get the hang of it. What I found interesting is when pointing out classes, even a single string can do that. When there is two words in the quotation, the code points out to two classes. The structures of those aren't too complicated but since I'm new to CSS, it took me a while to master them. I'll contnue to practice with classes and get into new selectors. 
* I didn't practice a lot with JavaScript. What I've done so far is using the class atribute to create classes. I didn't really focus on all parts yet but I will get into loops and arrays. 
* I struggled with TypeScript in particular since unlike JavaScript, TypeScript is stricter in terms of rules. Because using types like any makes the code easier, avoiding the abuse of them was a little difficult. Overall it's a good start for the semester but I have a long way to go. Nonetheless, I'll make progress and catch up with everyone else in the journey and not dawdle too much.
* When I was practicing with hooks in React
